# spherical-classification

Code for spherical classification method including the modeling process as well as the categorization techniques. The method is based on the work of . 

Modeling includes creating categorized clusters based on the training samples which are characterized by a center and two radial borders, a conservative and a liberal one. Code includes the categorization technique proposed by the paper, as well as two alternative ones based only on the distances between the test samples and the centers of the created clusters.
